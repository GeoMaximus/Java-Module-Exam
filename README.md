# Java Module Exam
Exam solution for the test taken at the end of the Java Module at DB

You must write a program that allows people to subscribe to their favorite subjects and receive notifications automatically when something happens.
In order to meet the requirements I implemented the following:
- Observer desing pattern in order to send notifications to the users when something changes
- Created a REST API that allows adding new clients to the application
- Created a REST API that allows clients to subscribe to an event
- Created a REST API that displays all the events that a certain client is subscribed to
- Added custom exceptions in order to provide better error handling

The project was developed using Spring Boot.
